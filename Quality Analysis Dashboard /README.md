# Quality Analysis Dashboard in Power BI

Welcome to the Quality Analysis Dashboard in Power BI repository. This project offers a comprehensive analysis and visualization of data using Power BI, focusing on quality analysis and insights. 

## Overview

In this repository, we have created a Quality Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to provide meaningful insights into your data. We have displayed **Total Task**,**Sample**, **Defect**, **Fatal Error**, and **Quality Score**.

### Data Exploration

We start by delving into the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. Our data exploration phase involves:

- Identifying missing values to ensure data completeness.
- Providing an overview of the dataset to give you a clear understanding of its contents.

### Data Visualization

To enhance data comprehension, we utilize various data visualization techniques, including:

- Scatter plots: Visualizing relationships and patterns within the data.
- Regression plots: Analyzing trends and correlations.
- Correlation matrices: Calculating correlation coefficients between numeric features.

1. This dashboard has two pages. The First page is the main dashboard page, wherein we have displayed multiple charts and cards for various metrics.


2. In the 2nd, we have displayed the tabular view by employee and supervisor.

### Quality Analysis

Our project emphasizes quality analysis, helping you uncover valuable insights and make informed decisions based on your data. We aim to empower users to extract meaningful information from their datasets with ease.
