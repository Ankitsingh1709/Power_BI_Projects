## Quality Analysis Dashboards in Power BI

Welcome to the Quality Analysis Dashboards in Power BI repository. This project encompasses a comprehensive analysis and visualization of data using Power BI, specifically focusing on quality analysis and insights.

### The dashboard can be used by a variety of stakeholders, including:

**Facility managers**,
**Energy managers**,
**Sustainability professionals**,
**Business owners and executives**

### Overview

This repository presents four distinct Power BI dashboards:

1. **Energy Consumption Overview Dashboard:** Provides a comprehensive overview of energy consumption data, including total consumption, consumption by city, type, and building, and a timeline of consumption over time.

2. **Water Energy Consumption Dashboard:** Offers a detailed analysis of water energy consumption, covering total consumption, consumption by city, building, and date, along with a breakdown of consumption by type (potable, non-potable, irrigation).

3. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dashboard:** Delivers insights into greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data, encompassing total emissions, emissions by scope, source, city, and sector, and a timeline of emissions over time.

4. **Renewable Energy Generation Dashboard:** Presents a comprehensive assessment of renewable energy generation data, including total generation, generation by type, location, and time, alongside a breakdown of generation by source (solar, wind, hydro, biomass).

### Key Findings

Across the four dashboards, we have identified several key findings:

1. **Energy Consumption:** Overall energy consumption has been steadily increasing over time, with significant variations observed across cities and building types.

2. **Water Energy Consumption:** Water energy consumption patterns are closely linked to energy consumption, with significant contributions from irrigation and non-potable water use.

3. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** GHG emissions are primarily driven by energy consumption, with varying emission intensities across different sectors.

4. **Renewable Energy Generation:** Renewable energy generation has shown promising growth, with solar and wind being the primary contributors.

### Data Exploration

Prior to conducting data visualization, we thoroughly explored the datasets to ensure data integrity and consistency. This involved:

1. **Missing Value Analysis:** Identifying and addressing missing values to maintain data completeness and reliability.

2. **Dataset Overview:** Providing a comprehensive overview of the datasets, including data types, descriptive statistics, and potential outliers.

### Data Visualization Techniques

To effectively convey the insights extracted from the data, we employed a variety of data visualization techniques:

1. **Bar charts:** Used to visualize total energy consumption by city, type, and building.

2. **Line charts:** Used to visualize energy consumption over time.

3. **Pie charts:** Used to visualize the breakdown of energy consumption by building type.

4. **Stacked bar charts:** Used to visualize renewable energy generation by type (solar, wind, hydro, biomass) and location.

5. **Radar charts:** Used to visualize renewable energy generation by source, considering multiple dimensions such as capacity, cost, and efficiency.

6. **Treemaps:** Used to visualize the breakdown of GHG emissions by source.

7. **Scatter plots:** Used to visualize the relationship between GHG emissions and energy consumption.


### The report has 4 dashboards
